## What is this?

This package can turn a string with tabs into a string with spaces.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package if *you* want to define how big the tab size is.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+, 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install detab
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {detab} from 'https://esm.sh/detab@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {detab} from 'https://esm.sh/detab@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {detab} from 'detab'

console.log(detab('\tfoo\nbar\tbaz'))
console.log(detab('\tfoo\nbar\tbaz', 2))
console.log(detab('\tfoo\nbar\tbaz', 8))
```

Yields:

```txt
    foo
bar baz
```

```txt
  foo
bar baz
```

```txt
        foo
bar     baz
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `detab`.
There is no default export.

### `detab(value[, size=4])`

Replace tabs with spaces in `value` (`string`), being smart about which column
the tab is at and which `size` (`number`, default: `4`) should be used.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+.
It also works in Deno and modern browsers.
